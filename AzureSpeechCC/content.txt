Hi.
OK.
Working.
A. What's the best way to do this then to test this new code?
So how does it look like? I've not done that yet, yeah.
Got the highest clubs.
So should I do that now? Try to do the GitHub stuff now?
Get Hub, not get Lab.
Yeah, the top, because that is mostly sharp code.
GitHub or GitHub? I don't care, yeah.
Walked before you.
Isn't there a positive on on the rest reply is not nothing or is there anything or?
So what do you mean?
Sort of hides their code. Or not, Yeah. OK, so this is exactly where we were.
Hello.
I think we're going to be in today.
How are you such a longing to see you?
Hello.
Great.
I was incommunicado for the last few days because I was in the City National Park. Ohh, I'd love it.
And he got soak for three pounds. It was really just yesterday at about this time, 10:00 o'clock.
You know, and it happened so fast, you know, in the Alps. And then so the dark clouds, the wind came and you know, just before you could say Jack Robinson, it just started pouring down and was encouraged. I mean, it was freezing.
And the day before twice. You know, it's it's a beautiful place. But you know when he had the Panopoulos because apparently there's lots of Steinberg, you know, these ones with the holes. Ohh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not unicorns, students having the proper, you know, another African.
I think you're right.
Anyway, so there's supposed to be lots of deer and whatever. And you know, brothers.
It's on the border with Italy, so you try go to toilets and then it's the valley to it's called Messiah.
And it's the only National Park goes back to 1914. So we've known thought about it and so it's quite a big area and everything is forbidden. So you have to stick to the party, you know and there's only one of the peaks which you can actually build out to go up the capitalized.
And otherwise, you aren't supposed to be flowers, but but it's really something special. There's only one they're huge there, and it used to be.
Shut for couple of years you couldn't sort of you could go there but you couldn't spend the night and it's just really opened and it's really nice to see traditional hearts and then next to it they've got all these local world and so on.
Just for the staff.
And it's really it's.
Well done. So anyway, that's where I was last.
9:00 o'clock.
Anyways, how are you?
Yeah, because you have 18 from, yeah, June, Tuesday night, later Tuesday.
Um, yeah. We had a good day yesterday. I feel like we've achieved.
Uh-huh. Great looking, promising. Uh-huh.
And the fact that it's.
Yeah, it's 10 minutes walk. Yeah, it's like.
It's got small kitchen. Yeah, it's just one room, but it's got a kitchen and a table, yeah. And it's got a nice roof terrace.
OK.
Yeah, but it's it's good. It's nice.
I don't know what it's called to just before you start to go up the hill, OK, isn't it? It's close to the cathedral on.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm guessing it's not. Yes. Yeah, very excited. Right. Yes. It's Tom here today. No, he was here yesterday and he told us to you tomorrow night. OK.
We had this thing coming tonight.
There's some.
Uh.
Yes.
And it only occurred to me last night that I hadn't told you about tonight. Did you? No. No. So is he around? Because I hadn't seen him yesterday. Yeah.
Yesterday, yeah. OK. So I might just say it's a bit short.
Short notice.
So you want to hear Yesterday we talked about this hub and repositories and I wanted to chat TPT to write Haiku.
Yeah, pushing fights with care. Feature branches, merge with grace, clean records, safe space.
So yeah, wow, this is like.
Excuse me?
So the idea that we sort of discussed last time, you know, people like as a father present to the participants that I choose that because something to ponder.
That's.
I think it's good. Yeah. I think it's very good. So the next step is the images. Yeah, yeah, we've got this.
So these are the things we're using for, and now we've got this.
This is the color you displace that's not plugged in, so it looks like a photograph. It's amazing, yeah.
Yeah.
Amazing.
And he hasn't.
That's the image. So what did you say? Just give me an incorrect variation of John.
You know.
Yeah. So I think the, I think the images, we did a quick test yesterday. Yeah, work. It generated images, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll see.
He's good and he's on holiday now.
They.
The entire family of going to France, yeah, really are in France.
But it's yeah, seems like time.
Felix's.
Doing much better.
And taking medications, yeah, yeah, yeah. And he's, the medications changed, which has been a bit complicated, but I saw Felix.
A couple of weeks ago, yeah. And he's improved so much more.
Just talking more.
Yeah, which is great. It's still very stressful for John. It'll be stressful for the rest of his life.
Something.
John is always worried about like if Felix ever goes away to university or whatever, it'll be something I think is apparent. You never forget that.
The adoption, yeah, we on Tuesday, so the morning before flying out, we had the adoption panel, yeah.
So hopefully.
We will be approved adopters. I think we are unanimous. Yes, parents, that's great.
So yeah, you know, it's just a long.
Alright, well, I don't know. Unknown process of looking at profiles of, yeah.
Kids and just see what works. I'm going to have to invest in some case and.
We've not been shortlisted for a few reasons. One was a couple like to a brother and a sister.
This is this is 1/3 sibling.
We were going to take 3.
There is now a third sibling and they didn't know there was a third sibling, but the two had never lived with the third story and they always like to keep siblings together because it's yeah, yeah, you know it's like they don't feel like an excited and finally.
And it's called 3 and in the last.
We showed some interest in.
And there was a mixed race family, which she still always will, will always win in a way. It's almost like top, top Trump's some. There's some aspects that will always beat, no matter how good you are is.
Yeah, you know, who knows how long it will take?
OK, but this, this. Like this, kids. Come on the website you look at, you set your filters.
Yeah and yeah.
Yeah.
City filters and you go through and this kids get added to pretty much every single day.
And you want to take two or is your wants to. Yeah, I want one, yeah. But I'm willing to to achieve, willing to take one. Depending on what we see. OK, depending on what.
So every case here? No, no, she had to.
Work.
No, no, no, unfortunately, yeah.
It's OK.
It's like everyone.
Friday.
So this weekend I'm gonna go exploring with Melanie and with.
Sebastian.
Settings.
So if he goes to say they're going climbing, yeah, I hope so. That whatever student you can go for rock climbing, yeah.
Advice you? Because me and my son and we go hacking into the machine or?
If you want to go to the lake, yeah.
With my son so.
Yeah, that's fine. But I think you guys trade, Yeah. Yes, he's really has a lot of energy.
OK. Thank you for lunch.
I'm not sure. Do you know what they offer today at the mansion so we can go and take the days on? And I mean the phone you had the other day. Yeah, OK, OK. Or maybe if the food does not look that nice, I have oil with me, vinegar and salt. Maybe we can go to the supermarket and grab them, grab cucumbers tonight. There's just going to be.
Excellent.
See you later, yeah.
So.
OK. Your question was how so?
I have to check it out right now, so on the referee pie swap at the moment.
What we suggested. OK, but this is not a good repository.
No, OK. I think we the first step is.
Um, we were gonna just meet this entire folder repository, yeah.
And I converted that I I code and then I'm gonna push test for the main file and then you're going to push to the main file again and again and again, so.
Do you know?
To the very back, I only know the way like if you have complete repository and clone the folder to your laptop. I have to have a look how you know how to create. I have to have a look at it, yeah.
Tutorial this is more for finishing this up on today.
Yeah, but at first you need a repository.
You have to create the repository on the.
On the Raspberry Pi.
No, we have a repository. Yeah, and follow it.
And then we have to move the folders into this repository and then be gonna push it up. Yeah. OK, so we have our repository. Repository. No, this is May I Yeah, yeah.
So at first we have to.
Because.
We have to add this S key from GitHub or create a new SSHD, otherwise you cannot communicate. This is the first thing you have to do.
Thank you.
Change the keyboard if you want.
Ohh.
Key 4 This is a.
The security key. Otherwise you cannot connect to the repo.
From the folder.
OK.
You're not working with repositories and folders on your computer, are you?
No, OK.
Otherwise, if you want to do that, you have to generate this key, this secure shell, yeah? And then if this key is connected, you can clone the repository and you can work on your computer and then you push and pull and have everything.
OK. Yeah.
Versions and.
I think it's great, but I just need to learn this. I'm like this is.
But I'm.
So rich e-mail address is so if you want yeah you can.
Removed and this is well, if you just want to copy and paste. Ohh yeah.
Where is the.
The quotation quotation.
Hello this is a quotation. This works. Can I use your e-mail address? Is it? This has to be the one for GitHub which is not that one. Is mail at mrshorter.co.uk. Let me just double check that.
It's mine. I don't care.
No.
This is the SSH key.
So now I remember again, I have a colleague in Robertsville but from this other project and he's this software developer and he's really great.
He helps me with that stuff, but not really forget the stuff. There is the till there.
Uh, umm no.
Ohh.
No.
I'm gonna make you sorry. Is it OK?
And also.
On this date for each site, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, ohh perfect.
But anyways, I have to go to GitHub right now and.
So.
There's the team here.
It's a normal year, right? Is it?
Just copy and paste difference.
Tilda, right?
Handle that.
With information.
Sure.
One more try.
What you could Google on Firefox there and it'll just copy paste there.
This is so slow.
I'm going to connect to GitHub.
You know, medium, yeah.
I think it's great I have an account.
Well, yeah, I have an account, right?
Easier.
Yeah, yeah.
Here you can do it.
You can log in hereaswell.com.
And.
Yeah. And then word cloud.
I think.
And then yeah.
And it's you have to go see word cloud.
Just ask you ohh, sorry.
Nothing worked quite.
Perfect. Thank you. Thank you.
OK.
Landmarks.
You're definitely copying.
Using Chrome.
Yes.
So this is our key.
Click on the profile in the right corner.
Ohh.
Hmm.
I have to, I'm not sure.
Add a new key.
So I'm not sure if I had added in the profile or if you have, I think you have to add it in your profile. Hmm, I'm not sure because this is my profile.
OK.
I'm not sure.
What do I need to edit?
Yeah, and you have to add.
One second.
Ohh.
OK, hmm.
One moment, I'm not sure because this is connected to my e-mail address.
Ohh.
OK, I added and then we create a new one with your e-mail address and then we're safe.
Title is.
Yeah, Ohh.
Pepper.
Types.
Ohh.
OK.
And I think you have to do the same.
Then you have to copy this.
Did that make him? Yes.
As well.
Cannot copy.
It said it copied. It did the little ohh.
Meant to be there, yeah, yeah.
You're right.
OK.
Now it worked OK.
So you have to do the same steps I'm gonna send you on the data quality. I think you have to connect as well and you have to set your e-mail address because.
Or which is.
I'm going to have a look if this works.
Vertical.
Yes.
The Raspberry Pi starts up and then it points to this directory here.
Directory. Yeah. So the workout directory has to be there. Be there, has to look that up. Yeah. OK and yeah.
And if I.
Change now the folder like uberblick.
Repository we have to change it in the startup file.
This is the name of the folder.
Is that a really big problem?
I think we have problems because we have to change it everywhere the past.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we don't.
Why do we need to?
Because if.
Let's see.
Flexible.
It's just if we can avoid it.
You might as well avoid it.
I'm not sure with this key top repository on Raspberry pie.
This is not working.
I think it's a problem to change that.
The file, the folder name. Is it a problem or not? Is fixable?
OK.
Where are the quotas?
Quotation. Yeah, I cannot find them.
They should be.
Yeah.
But this is the wrong one and it's double double shift and the same shift and.
Ohh.
You have to ask a question because.
I was developing code.
And.
Then we.
Huh.
This is not.
This is Zero or OH.
Zero, I think.
I don't know why.
OMF.
He didn't copy the file.
For this project, but he told me he he thinks it's the best idea to go in this repository and because we're developing, we only have to make to pull from the report, so it's the best thing to do, he said.
To do what?
To close this repository and I just wrapped up my head. You don't need e-mail address anymore, so you don't need to do that. Because you have this SSH key on, this is generated and so now the Raspberry Pi can connect to.
Click it.
Have.
The only problem is.
No, I can't do that.
Because I have confidential stuff in my GitHub repository.
For our project we have to generate it again with your e-mail address.
And then you have to look you because I can't do that because I think the Raspberry Pi has now.
Can access the whole.
If you have the password.
Yeah, we do it with your e-mail address because it's too. This is too hard for me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I delete that file again and we create it again.
So there was it.
Home birth Cloud SSH.
Home.
SH.
Hmm.
So the file is deleted and we generate this again.
With your e-mail address mail Mr. Shorter.
1st.
Yeah, Minister. Yeah, shorter SH. This is your private website. yeah.co.uk.
Like this? Yeah.
Cats.
But this cat is not her inside anymore. I'll do that.
Here.
No.
So if you please can.
So I'll remove this here. Hmm.
And maybe.
You can log in from my computer, please. You're in.
And then?
Let's just keep.
What do you oht sorry about?
Lost in translation?
I don't know.
Hmm.
Explanation Mark Explanation excellent this one.
Ohh.
This is uh.
I think.
Yeah.
Confusing.
OK, can you log yourself in here as well please? Thank you. And then I add this key.
Who's that?
No, this is a British, I think. Yeah, of course, yeah.
Thank you.
So this I added you.
And if you want to do the same on your Mac, you have to generate in the terminal the new SSH key.
OK or you can use this one. Then you add this SSH key to your system.
I did it. I've added in your account. Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.
Ohh sorry.
So and we have here.
The Reco.
And now you can clone the repo via SSH. Now you have access to the repository.
So, umm.
Um.
So.
I'm not sure.
OK.
It's in the home directory.
So we're changing the file name there, are we? Yeah, I think so.
So.
You have now. Here is the repository.
OK, and this is empty.
Umm.
So now we have to think because this code up on the repo yes because but the main is not running.
I'm following it and then I'm changing my then it should run. OK, you can do that but.
So I'm gonna take all of this stuff here. Yeah, yeah, don't do the assembly AI. You can read that folder, right?
I copied this.
